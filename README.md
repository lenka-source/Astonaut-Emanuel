# Astronaut Emanuel
### game with basic fundamentals for continuous development
This is my first project using python and pygame.
## Gameplay
The player's goal is to pick up randomly generated floppy discs floating in space as fast as possible while simultaneously dodging floating asteroids that are slowing the player down on impact.
## Lore
Astronaut Emanuel has been assinged to a mission. A mission regarding a safe transport of mysterious old data storage media like floppy discs, hard disc drives, CDs and VHSs. There were no further instructions for this odd mission. On his way from point A to point B, his ship gets wrongfuly diverted from the course into the raging asteroid belt. This causes destruction of the ship and scattering the storage media all around the infinite space.
